# jms1org

This is an organization that I've used in the past when I needed to collaborate with corporate clients who aren't able to give me direct access to their internal repos, usually due to internal security policies. Their repos may be hosted with Github under a private organization, or they may be on an internal git server which isn't accessible from the outside world.

The idea is this:

* At the start of the project, I add one or more of their employees' Github accounts as members of this organization, with permission to create repos.
* They create *copies* of the internal repos they need me to access, under this organzation.
* The work they need is done using the repos in this organization.
* When the project is done, they copy the repos back to their internal server, and delete the repos from this organization. (This way they *know* the repos aren't still sitting here.)
* When they let me know they're ready, I remove their Github users from this organization.

Github doesn't seem to charge anything for having an organization like this, and the name `jms1org` is fairly specific to me (I've been using `jms1` as an identifier since 1993), so even if I don't have a project going on which *needs* this org, I'm keeping it around so I can hang on to the name.
